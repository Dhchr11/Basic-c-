2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts 
-OOP means Object-Oriented Programming

OOP allows objects to interact with each other using four basic principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These four OOP principles enable objects to communicate and collaborate to create powerful applications.

- Parameter	OOP	POP
Definition	This type of programming language uses objects and classes for creating models. 	This programming language uses a step-by-step approach for breaking down a task into a collection of routines and variables by following a sequence of instructions.
Abbreviation	Object-Oriented Programming	Procedure Oriented Programming
Approach	Bottom-up approach	Top-down approach
Polymorphism	Method overloading and overriding are used in OOP to achieve polymorphism.	It doesn’t support polymorphism.
Inheritance	Supports	Do not support
Code Reusability	Supports 	Don’t support
Security	Data handling is possible in OOP due to programming.	It is less secure than OOP.
Problem-Solving	Used for solving big problems.	Not suitable for big problems.
Example	C++, JAVA, C#, .NET	C, FORTRAN
